    "# Create N-Gram List from Excel Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows the user to enter a directory containing pre-processed Excel files after passing through an LLM in order to grab the distinct list of n-grams created when doing n-gram tracing. This will be used to filter out past results but also for future iterations this idea will be used prior to sending requests to an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future i will process all of the documents in n-gram tracing and output a file similar to this containing all possible n-grams in common. Then i will create a filtered list to remove some before processing them next time around and keep iterating on this list with each corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Done to save time and money if using OpenAI as i feel the main 2-grams will be featured reguoarly."
